# Ralph Demo - Progress Log

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates refactoring a Java enum (DeploymentTarget) to a database-backed entity (Target).
The goal is to show incremental, test-driven migration while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Codebase Patterns
- Package: com.demo
- Java 17
- JUnit 5 for testing
- Gradle build system

## Key Files
- src/main/java/com/demo/DeploymentTarget.java - Enum to deprecate
- src/main/java/com/demo/Feature.java - Uses DeploymentTarget
- src/main/java/com/demo/FeatureService.java - Service layer
- src/test/java/com/demo/FeatureTest.java - Feature tests
- src/test/java/com/demo/FeatureServiceTest.java - Service tests

## Learnings
- US-001: Created Target data class with id-based equality.
- US-002: Implemented TargetRepository with InMemory implementation.
- US-003: Added conversion logic between DeploymentTarget enum and Target entity.
- US-004: Updated Feature class to support both old and new target models.
- US-005: Updated FeatureService to use Target entity, maintaining backward compatibility.
- US-006: Deprecated DeploymentTarget enum.
- Integration: Integrated TargetRepository into FeatureService and seeded it with legacy targets.
- Architecture: Decoupled Feature class from DeploymentTarget enum, allowing for truly dynamic targets.
- Safety: Added null-safety checks and improved robustness of conversion methods.
- General: Fixed Gradle version mismatch to support Java 21 environment.
